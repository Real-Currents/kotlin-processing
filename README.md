Playing around with [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) and [Processing](https://processing.org/) to create Generative Art...

I was inspired by a [blog post](http://www.tylerlhobbs.com/writings/watercolor) by [@thobbs](https://github.com/thobbs) about Generative Art.  I read a couple of [other](http://www.tylerlhobbs.com/writings/generative-colors) [posts](http://www.tylerlhobbs.com/writings/circle-packing) and started playing with Kotlin and Processing to see what I could do...

Had some fun and created something to show.  

(If you want to run the code to create similar art, you need to run from the IDE. I couldn't get Gradle to run Processing from the CLI (but I didn't try hard to figure it out).)
